/*
The "left" and "right" variables on lines 1-2 and lines 10-12 are not the same 
variables. You can demonstrate this by changing the variables 
on lines 1-2 to something different (like "number1" and "number2"), and seeing
that this does not affect the logic or functionality of the code. The variables
on lines 1-2 are local to the function while the variables on 10-12 are global
in scope.
