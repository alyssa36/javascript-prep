/*
Exception handling allows us to anticipate errors and handle them predictably
within our program so that Javascript doesn't return an error or stop running 
the program. It is useful for anticipating things like a user inputting 
information in the wrong format. It uses the try/catch syntax to catch 
exceptions.
